Archive of my tweets using a modified version of [twitter-archive-parser](https://github.com/timhutton/twitter-archive-parser/).

Modified script is [here](parser.py)

Source code of the website can be found [here](https://github.com/x4d3/twitter-archives)

All the tweets were exported to markdown and grouped by year.
